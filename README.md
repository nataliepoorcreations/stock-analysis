# An Analysis of Stocks in 2017 and 2018
Performing an analysis on stocks by refactoring code written in the Module to perform the same analysis of the stocks faster and more efficiently. The refactored code runs much more efficiently and quickly than the previous code. 
## Results
When running the analysis I found that the sum of the volume for the stocks were mostly higher in 2017 than 2018. I used a pivot table to show the comparison between 2017 and 2018 and then I did a few diffent graphs for a visual representation of the stocks.

- This next graph shows a comparison of the Volume Sum for each stock by year.

- This graph shows a compariosn of the Percentage of Return for each stock by year.

The execution times for the Stock Analyis were very close in timing.

## Summary

The advantages of refactoring the original code are saving time and money, helps find bugs, and reducing complexity for an  easier understanding. Clean code is much easier to update and improve. Some of the disadvantages are possible time constraints where it's better to leave the code rather than dupicate or not have enough time to test the rewritten code. Another con is to create bugs in already working code. Refactoring my original code improved the run time and was much easier to understand.
